## Container
Container is a packaged software (which includes code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings) created using OS-level virtualization. OS-level virtualization refers to an operating system paradigm in which the kernel allows the existence of multiple isolated user space instances.

This packaging makes containers isolated & independent of host operating system.

Containers are built on namespaces, control groups & union-capable file systems (UCFS), which makes it act like an Operating System with its own user-space but no kernel-space. Rather it uses the kernel of the host OS. [Namespaces](/concepts/definitions-readme.md#namespaces) control what a process can see i.e. Process Isolation, while control groups (Cgroups) regulate what they can use i.e. Resource Management.

## Pod
It is the smallest compute unit that can be defined, deployed and managed, encapsulating one or more containers deployed together on one host. Each pod is allocated its own internal IP address, and containers within pods can share their local storage and networking. Pods are immutable when running. Pod is like a container hosting other containers. In Kubernetes world, Pods are scaled, not the individual containers.

Each Pod has a routable IP address assigned to it, not to the containers running within it. Having a shared
network space for all containers means that the containers inside can communicate with one another over the localhost address, a feature not present in traditional Docker networking.

> The most common use of a Pod is to run a single container. Some projects inject containers into running Pods to deliver a service. An example of this is the **Istio service mesh**, which uses this injected container as a proxy for all communication.

### ReplicaSet
The ReplicaSet maintains the desired number of copies of a Pod running within the cluster. If a Pod or the host on which it's running fails, Kubernetes launches a replacement. In all cases, Kubernetes works to maintain the desired state of the ReplicaSet.

### Deployment
A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets. You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. You can define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployments.

### DaemonSet
A DaemonSet runs one copy of the Pod on each node in the Kubernetes cluster. This workload model provides the flexibility to run daemon processes such as log management, monitoring, storage providers, or network providers that handle Pod networking for the cluster. 

### StatefulSet
A StatefulSet controller ensures that the Pods it manages have durable storage and persistent identity. StatefulSets are appropriate for situations where Pods have a similar definition but need a unique identity, ordered deployment and scaling, and storage that persists across Pod rescheduling. For details, refer this [blog](https://platform9.com/blog/stateful-applications-with-kubernetes/)
* Volume - storage thatâ€™s attached to the pod and its lifecycle. A volume has no persistence at all. Once the pod is destroyed, its local volume is also released.
* emptyDir - temporary storage created by the pod & mounted on the container. Unlike volume, where the pod will simply attach the storage to the mount.
* Persistent Volume - storage that is persisted outside the lifecycle of the pods. It is provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using Storage Classes. Persistent Volume is managed by the cluster & their data can be retained & backed up.
* PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) - binds the persistent volume to a pod. It defines the amount of storage and the access mode. It is similar to a Pod. Pods consume node resources and PVCs consume PV resources. Pods can request specific levels of resources (CPU and Memory). Claims can request specific size and access modes (e.g., they can be mounted ReadWriteOnce, ReadOnlyMany or ReadWriteMany, see AccessModes). For details, refer to [life cycle of a volume & claim](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#lifecycle-of-a-volume-and-claim)
* StorageClass - It is used for dynamically provisioing PVs. Cluster administrators need to be able to offer a variety of PersistentVolumes that differ in more ways than size and access modes, without exposing users to the details of how those volumes are implemented. For these needs, there is the StorageClass resource. Each StorageClass has a <ins>provisioner</ins> that determines what volume plugin is used for provisioning PVs. This field must be specified. For details, refer to [StorageClass](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/)
